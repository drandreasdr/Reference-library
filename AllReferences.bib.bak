  Abstract                 = {It is known that the addition and elimination of suitable bubble functions can result in a stabilized scheme of the SUPG-type. Residual-Free Bubbles (RFB), in particular, can assure a quasi-optimal stabilized scheme, but they are difficult to compute in one dimension and nearly impossible to compute in two and three dimensions, unless in special limit cases. Strongly convection-dominated problems (without reaction terms) are one of these cases, where it is possible to find reasonably simple computable bubbles that provide a stabilizing effect as good as that of true RFB. Here, although in a one-dimensional framework, we analyze the case in which a non-negligible reaction term is present, and provide a simple recipe for spotting a suitable bubble space (adding two bubbles to each element) that provides a very good stabilizing effect. The method adapts very well to all regimes with continuous transitions from one regime to another. It is clear that the one-dimensional case, in itself, has no real interest. We believe, however, that the discussion can cast some light on the interaction between convection and reaction that could be useful in future works dealing with multidimensional, more realistic problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Residual-free bubbles have been recently introduced in order to compute optimal values for the stabilization methods \'{a} la Hughes-Franca. However, unless in very special situations (one-dimensional problems, limit cases, etc.) they require the actual solution of \{PDE\} problems (the bubble problems) in each element. Thus, they are very difficult to be used in practice. In this paper we present, for the special case of convection-dominated elliptic problems, a cheap way to compute approximately the solution of the bubble problem in each element. This provides, as a consequence, a cheap way to compute good approximations for the optimal values of the stabilization parameters. },

  Abstract                 = {A new finite element formulation for convection dominated flows is developed. The basis of the formulation is the streamline upwind concept, which provides an accurate multidimensional generalization of optimal one-dimensional upwind schemes. When implemented as a consistent Petrov-Galerkin weighted residual method, it is shown that the new formulation is not subject to the artificial diffusion criticisms associated with many classical upwind methods.
The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical examples. The formulation is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. An efficient implicit pressure/explicit velocity transient algorithm is developed which accomodates several treatments of the incompressibility constraint and allows for multiple iterations within a time step. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of vortex shedding from a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100.},

An efficient and reliable algorithm for the calculation of stresses and strains either for an arbitrary number of loading passes or directly for the stabilized state is presented. Two numerical procedures are proposed: (i) the pass-by-pass stationary method (PPSM) which rigorously treats the case of a single load pass; (ii) the direct stationary method (DSM) going straight to the steady state in the case of a repeatedly moving load. Although the scope of application of these methods is wide, numerical results obtained in the case of rolling and sliding contact only are presented and compared with already published results.},

Applications are discussed in fluid dynamics, nonlinear solid mechanics and coupled problems describing fluid--structure interaction. The need for an adequate mesh-update strategy is underlined, and various automatic mesh-displacement prescription algorithms are reviewed. This includes mesh-regularization methods essentially based on geometrical concepts, as well as mesh-adaptation techniques aimed at optimizing the computational mesh according to some error indicator. Emphasis is then placed on particular issues related to the modeling of compressible and incompressible flow and nonlinear solid mechanics problems. This includes the treatment of convective terms in the conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy, as well as a discussion of stress-update procedures for materials with history-dependent constitutive behavior.},

Presented examples include rolling contact on a corrugated surface and negotiation of a surface discontinuity. Sensitivity and validation analyses are presented and show the model to be robust and the trends in parametric responses to be reasonable as compared to results in literature. Owing to the ALE formulation, the model can be kept very compact and the computational demands very modest.},

Integrated simulations of high-frequency dynamic train--track interaction and prediction of RCF impact are then carried out to evaluate the influence of short-pitch rail corrugation on RCF of railway wheels. Parametric studies are carried out to identify operational conditions likely to generate high RCF impact. Simulation results show how rail corrugation causes a major increase in RCF impact at high-speed operations and that corrugation magnitudes measured in-field are sufficient to generate subsurface initiated RCF. At high speeds the main cause for increased fatigue impact is the increase in dynamic load magnitudes. At lower speeds and higher axle loads also the effect of poor contact geometry will have an influence.},

Next, the advective-diffusive model is approximated in the light of various stabilized methods, a global convergence analysis is presented and numerical experiments are performed. Biquadratic elements produce better numerical results under all stabilized methods examined. The design of the stability parameter is confirmed to be a crucial ingredient for simulating the advective-diffusive model, and some improved possibilities are suggested. Combinations of these methodologies are given in the conclusions and will be examined in detail in the sequel to this paper applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. },

The model can be used to speed up and improve the design and evaluation of the roughing and finishing phases in plate and sheet production. It is able to calculate the temperature distribution in the roll and the plate, the stress and strain fields, throughout a transient analysis done starting from the first phases of the process. The main hypotheses adopted in the formulation are: the elasto-plastic behaviour of the material; and rolling under plane-deformation conditions. The main variables that characterise the rolling process, such as the geometry of the plate and the roll, the loads and the boundary conditions (radius of the rolls, rolling speed, initial and final thickness, initial temperatures of the plate and the roll), have been expressed in a parametric form, this approach giving a good flexibility to the model. During the simulation, an iterative procedure enables the calculation and updating of the load conditions, such as the heat produced by friction on the plate-roll contact arc, and that caused by plastic deformation. The congruence of the results has been evaluated using experimental and theoretical data available in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a three-dimensional (3D) thermal-structure coupling model, implements transient stress analysis of thermoelastic contact of disk brakes with a frictional heat variation and identifies the source of the thermal fatigue. This thermostructure model allows the analysis of the effects of the moving heat source (the pad) with a variable speed and integrates the heat flux coupling between the sliding surfaces. To obtain the transient stress/temperature fields of the brake under an emergency braking, the thermoelastic problem under this 3D model is solved by the finite element method. The numerical results from the analysis and simulation show the temperature/stress of the disk presenting periodic sharp fluctuation due to the continuous cyclic loading; its varying frequency corresponds to the rotated cycle times of the braking disk. The results demonstrate that the maximum surface equivalent stress may exceed the material yield strength during an emergency braking, which may cause a plastic damage accumulation in a brake disk, while a residual tensile hoop stress is incurred on cooling. These results are validated by experimental observation results available in the literature. Based on these numerical results, some suggestions for avoiding fatigue fracture propagation are further presented.},

A review of the kinematics and field equations from an arbitrary reference is presented and since the major challenge of the ALE description lies in the mesh rezoning algorithm, various methods, including a new mixed formulation, are developed to update the mesh and map the moving domain in a more rational manner. Moreover, the streamline-upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation is implemented to accurately describe highly convective free surface flows. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on a tsunami problem, the dam-break problem where the Reynolds number is taken as high as 3000, and a large-amplitude sloshing problem.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work we set to examine several important issues pertinent to currently very active research area of the finite element modeling of flexible multibody system dynamics. To that end, we first briefly introduce three different model problems in non-linear dynamics of flexible 3D solid, a rigid body and 3D geometrically exact beam, which covers the vast majority of representative models for the particular components of a multibody system. The finite element semi-discretization for these models is presented along with the time-discretization performed by the mid-point scheme. In extending the proposed methodology to modeling of flexible multibody systems, we also present how to build a systematic representation of any kind of joint connecting two multibody components, a typical case of holonomic contraint, as a linear superposition of elementary constraints. We also indicate by a chosen model of rolling contact, an example of non-holonomic constraint, that the latter can also be included within the proposed framework. An important aspect regarding the reduction of computational cost while retaining the consistency of the model is also addressed in terms of systematic use of the rigid component hypothesis, mass lumping and the appropriate application of the explicit--implicit time-integration scheme to the problem on hand. Several numerical simulations dealing with non-linear dynamics of flexible multibody systems undergoing large overall motion are presented to further illustrate the potential of presented methodology. Closing remarks are given to summarize the recent achievements and point out several directions for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {Rolling contact stress and failure analyses were conducted for the Hadfield steel (manganese steel) and the Bainitic alloy (J7). The first alloy is used in diamond crossings and frogs in the railroad industry while the second alloy is a candidate for such applications. A series of fatigue experiments were conducted on these alloys to establish the damage parameters. The proposed fatigue damage parameter incorporated the role of both shear and normal stress ranges on the `critical' plane upon surveying all planes at a material point. Maximum local plastic strains, accumulated strains, and three-dimensional residual stresses were computed under pure rolling conditions for po/k (Hertzian pressure normalized by yield stress in shear) values in the range 4.0 to 8.0 using a semi-analytical approach. A multiaxial stress�strain plasticity model developed by the authors was used in the calculations of the contact stress and strain fields. The advantage of this model over the previous models is that it predicts the correct trends in the material ratchetting rate and non-proportional loading response. For life prediction, a new combined ratchetting--multiaxial fatigue damage model was presented. The damage at different depths below the surface was interrogated with this model to determine the location where failure will originate. The results show that the Bainitic alloy exhibits longer lives under the same Hertzian pressure and for both materials the life is finite when the normalized pressure, po/k ratio, exceeded 4.0.},

  Abstract                 = {The common engineering applications of rolling contact are reviewed: the wheel, rolling bearings, traction drives, gears and cams. It is shown that increasing the rigidity of the materials and decreasing the conformity of the surfaces reduces the resistance to rolling, but only at the expense of higher contact stress. The principal modes of failure are described: plastic deformation, contact fatigue, wear, scuffing and corrugation. Recent research into plastic deformation and fatigue is discussed. It is concluded that, if wear and scuffing are controlled by adequate lubrication and surface finish, and clean steel is used, the load capacity and life are governed by the nucleation of micro shear cracks through the action of cyclic plastic deformation.},

In addition, non-linear finite-element simulations are carried out. Key data needed for the numerical evaluations, as well as difficulties in translating experimental data to numerical models are highlighted. A key parameter here is the interfacial wheel�rail friction. Additional simulations were carried out to establish the latter. However, the conformal contact in the linear test rig makes such simulations very uncertain.},

  Abstract                 = {Experiments have been performed on specimens subjected to strain cycles similar to those experienced by sub-surface elements of material in rolling/sliding contact. It has been observed that if the strain cycle is closed then failure takes place by low cycle fatigue and the Coffin-Manson relationship may be used to predict the number of cycles to failure. If however, the strain cycle is open, so that the material accumulates unidirectional plastic strain (the situation known as "ratchetting") a different type of failure, which is termed ratchetting failure may occur. It occurs when the total accumulated plastic strain reaches a critical value which is comparable with the strain to failure in a monotonic tension test. The number of cycles to failure under these circumstances may be estimated by dividing this critical strain by the ratchetting strain per cycle. It is suggested that low cycle fatigue and ratchetting are independent and competitive mechanisms so that failure occurs by whichever of them corresponds to a shorter life. The results of both uniaxial and biaxial tests reported in the literature have been re-evaluated and these, together with new data on biaxial tests on copper, found to be consistent with this hypothesis.},

  Abstract                 = {In a three-part series of papers, a generalized finite element solution strategy is developed to handle traveling load problems in rolling, moving and rotating structure. The main thrust of this section consists of the development of 3-D and shell type moving elements. In conjunction with this work, a compatible 3-D contact strategy is also developed. Based on these modeling capabilities, extensive analytical and experimental benchmarking is presented. Such testing includes traveling loads in rotating structure as well as low- and high-speed rolling contact involving standing wave-type response behavior. These point to the excellent modeling capabilities of moving element strategies. },

Several well-established radiation boundary conditions appear as special cases, corresponding to different choices of the coefficients in the rational approximation. The relation between these choices is established, and an explicit formulation in terms of selected directions with ideal transmission is presented. A mechanical interpretation of the fictitious surface densities enables identification of suitable conditions at corners and boundaries of the radiating surface. Numerical examples illustrate excellent results with one or two fictitious layers with suitable corner and boundary conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {A local boundary condition is formulated, representing radiation of elastic waves from an arbitrary point source. The boundary condition takes the form of a tensor relation between the stress at a point on an arbitrarily oriented section and the velocity and displacement vectors at the point. The tensor relation generalizes the traditional normal incidence impedance condition by accounting for the angle between wave propagation and the surface normal and by including a generalized stiffness term due to spreading of the waves. The effectiveness of the local tensor radiation condition is demonstrated by detailed finite element time and frequency analysis of a concentrated force in infinite three-dimensional space, and by a time analysis of a pulse load in a two-dimensional underground gallery.},

  Abstract                 = {In simulations of contact/impact phenomena using finite element techniques, spurious oscillations and /or numerical instabilities continue to pose considerable difficulty for many analysts. Recently, the combination of thermodynamically based stability estimates and energy-momentum numerical approaches has proven to be useful in developing effective, unconditionally stable algorithms for mechanical contact/impact in the fully nonlinear regime. In this paper, these ideas are extended to coupled interface problems, by developing a new a priori stability estimate for the fully coupled thermomechanical contact problem in large deformations. The model framework encompasses inelastic heating and thermal softening within the contacting bodies, as well as frictional heating and thermal softening of the coefficient of friction on sliding interfaces. Also incorporated are pressure dependent heat transfer across these interfaces, and a fully coupled treatment of the conductive heat transfer occurring within the bodies. Use of the stability estimate to extend energy-momentum approaches to dissipative and thermally coupled phenomena is discussed, as is the development of an unconditionally stable adiabatic split of the coupled problem. The latter is shown to be useful in developing partitioned integration schemes for the coupled equations of evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {The method for the development of the equations of motion for systems of constrained particles and rigid bodies, developed by T. R. Kane and called Kane's Equations, is discussed from a geometric viewpoint. It is shown that what Kane calls partial velocities and partial angular velocities may be interpreted as components of tangent vectors to the system's configuration manifold. The geometric picture, when attached to Kane's formalism shows that Kane's Equations are projections of the Newton-Euler equations of motion onto a spanning set of the configuration manifold's tangent space. One advantage of Kane's method, is that both non-holonomic and non-conservative systems are easily included in the same formalism. This easily follows from the geometry. It is also shown that by transformation to an orthogonal spanning set, the equations can be diagonalized in terms of what Kane calls the generalized speeds. A further advantage of the geometric picture lies in the treatment of constraint forces which can be expanded in terms of a spanning set for the orthogonal complement of the configuration tangent space. In all these developments, explicit use is made of a concrete realization of the multidimensional vectors which are called K-vectors for a K-component system. It is argued that the current presentation also provides a clear tutorial route to Kane's method for those schooled in classical analytical mechanics.},

  Abstract                 = {The prediction of damage and wear of materials under repeated moving contacts requires first the determination of the limit response in terms of stress and strain. The simulation necessary to calculate the limit response could be performed with classical finite elements and an incremental treatment of the loading history, resulting in lenghtly are repeated calculations. For steady-state moving contacts, the stationary methods allows a quick evaluation of the stabilized state. These procedures cannot be used in the case of an arbitrary cyclic loading resulting, for example, from small oscillatory contacts. In this paper, a new finite element approach is developed for structures subjected to an arbitrary cyclic loading. It is based on an original intergration scheme which allows direct determination of the stabilized state of stresses, strains and internal parameters. This asymptotic state could be either an elastic shakedown, a plastic shakedown or ratchetting for an elastic-plastic material. Elastic and plastic shakedown states are easily obtained with this method. Applications to fretting fatigue and wear in relation to material fatigue properties are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The weighting function of the streamline-upwind/Petrov-Galerkin method contains a coefficient which has the dimension of time and is a function of element parameters (e.g. element dimension, element Peclet number, etc.). In this paper a formula for the coefficient applicable to linear triangular elements is presented. The formula does not consist of the individual element parameters but rather of the element matrices only, and so it is not only simple but also cost-effective. The validity of the formula is shown by several test problems and numerical examples.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine a bubble-stabilized finite element method for enforcing Dirichlet constraints on embedded interfaces. By �embedded� we refer to problems of general interest wherein the geometry of the interface is assumed independent of some underlying bulk mesh. As such, the robust imposition of Dirichlet constraints using a Lagrange multiplier field is not trivial. To focus issues, we consider a simple one-sided problem that is representative of a wide class of evolving-interface problems. The bulk field is decomposed into coarse and fine scales, giving rise to coarse-scale and fine-scale one-sided sub-problems. The fine-scale solution is approximated with bubble functions, permitting static condensation and giving rise to a stabilized form bearing strong analogy with a classical method. Importantly, the method is simple to implement, readily extends to multiple dimensions, obviates the need to specify any free stabilization parameters, and can lead to a symmetric, positive-definite system of equations. The performance of the method is then examined through several numerical examples. The accuracy of the Lagrange multiplier is compared to results obtained using a local version of the domain integral method. The variational multiscale approach proposed herein is shown to both stabilize the Lagrange multiplier and improve the accuracy of the post-processed fluxes.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerical methods for the analysis of rolling contact problems are of high importance for the optimization of the components, car tires for example. Today, finite element methods for the computation of stationary rolling contact have been developed for industrial use. However, from a review of the scientific literature it has been concluded that the theoretical foundations of the relative kinematic description, i.e. an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation, seems to be not well understood in detail. This presentation is aimed to close this gap. Starting from the basic kinematic description of the ALE-formulation of rolling the weak form of the equations of motion are developed. By this careful analysis an additional flux contribution is derived which has not been recognized in the scientific literature so far. The contact problem is described for the treatment of two deformable bodies in rolling contact within the framework of well established methods for the numerical treatment of contact in the Lagrangian picture in general. Essential differences between the Lagrangian description and the ALE-description of rolling are shown up and discussed in detail. For a comprehensive presentation the finite element discretization is restricted to the case of a deformable wheel rolling on a rigid plane surface. However, the sketched algorithmic approach is valid in general. The efficiency of the numerical algorithms developed so far are discussed by the analysis of a simple three-dimensional example. Critical remarks and an outlook to further research in this field concludes this presentation.},

In particular, the consequences of short-pitch rail corrugation on tangent track with wavelengths in the interval 3--8 cm are simulated using models of dynamic vehicle--track interaction. Based on the calculated results, a criterion in terms of a limit for maximum levels of rail roughness with respect to the current traffic conditions can be determined. Such a criterion may be useful for planning of rail grinding intervals if used together with a system for regular monitoring of rail roughness levels. It is concluded that the importance of controlling rail roughness increases with increasing train speed. Increasing axle loads on freight vehicles from 22.5 tonnes to 30 tonnes leads to a significant increase in RCF impact. In operational practice, this is usually compensated for by introducing more conformal wheel--rail profile combinations. Calculated vertical wheel--rail contact forces and rolling noise levels show good agreement with field measurements.},

Features of the included models and possibilities of applications are outlined. The influence of short-pitch rail corrugation and wheel out-of-roundness (OOR) on RCF of a high-speed passenger train is investigated. It is shown how the corrugation and the OOR will have a profound effect in that levels of wheel and rail irregularities that have been measured in the field may be sufficient to generate subsurface-initiated RCF. In particular, the high-frequency content of the contact forces is of importance. Errors induced by neglecting such high-frequency components in measurements and/or simulations are investigated by comparing RCF indices based on contact forces that have been low-pass filtered with various cut-off frequencies. To avoid cracking due to RCF, a maximum roughness level in the wavelength interval up to 10 cm is sought. To limit the effects of corrugation, grinding practices have been altered leading to a significant decrease in RCF.},

  Abstract                 = {In a three-part series of papers, a generalized finite element analysis scheme is developed to handle the steady and transient response of moving/rolling nonlinear viscoelastic structure. This paper considers the development of the moving/rolling element strategy, including the effects of large deformation kinematics and viscoelasticity modeled by fractional integrodifferential operators. To improve the solution strategy, a special hierarchical constraint procedure is developed for the case of steady rolling/translating as well as a transient scheme involving the use of a Grunwaldian representation of the fractional operator. In the second and third papers [R. Kennedy and J. Padovan, Comput. Struct.27, 259�273 (1987) and Y. Nakajima and J. Padovan, Comput. Struct.27, 275�286 (1987)], 3-D extensions are developed along with transient contact strategies enabling the handling of impacts with obstructions. Overall the various developments are benchmarked via comprehensive 2- and 3-D simulations. These are correlated with experimental data to define modeling capabilities. },

  Abstract                 = {Heat generation due to plastic deformation of metals and steel is studied. Whereas in many investigations it is assumed that the fraction \eta of the plastic work transformed into heat is constant throughout the deformation process, the fraction \eta is here derived from thermodynamic considerations in a large-strain setting. It is shown that for elasto-plasticity the fraction \eta follows as a result of the choice of free energy, potential function and yield function. Taking the stress--strain response and the dissipative properties of the material as basis for calibration, it is shown that the thermodynamic framework of a thermoplastic material is non-unique for the general situation of non-associated plasticity. In the investigation conducted here, the mechanical response and the portion of the plastic work converted into heat (or into stored energy) during plastic deformations is predicted by means of isotropic hardening von Mises plasticity. It is shown that for a situation in which the internal variable is taken as the effective plastic, close fitting to experimental data requires a non-associated format of the evolution law for the internal variable.},

  Abstract                 = {Two general algorithms for refining triangular computational meshes based on the bisection of triangles by the longest side are presented and discussed. The algorithms can be applied globally or locally for selective refinement of any conforming triangulation and always generate a new conforming triangulation after a finite number of interactions even when locally used. The algorithms also ensure that all angles in subsequent refined triangulations are greater than or equal to half the smallest angle in the original triangulation; the shape regularity of all triangles is maintained and the transition between small and large triangles is smooth in a natural way. Proofs of the above properties are presented. The second algorithm is a simpler, improved version of the first which retains most of the properties of the latter. The algorithms can be used either for constructing irregular computational meshes or for locally refining any given triangulation. In this sense they can be adequately combined with adaptive and/or multigrid techniques for solving finite element systems. Examples of the application of the algorithms are given and two possible generalizations are pointed out.},

Penalized variational formulations are performed to connect the interface or contact interfaces with the neighboring subdomains that satisfy continuity constraints on the displacement and temperature fields. As a result, non-linear finite element computations due to the contact boundaries can be localized within a few subdomains or contact interfaces. Therefore, the computational efficiency can be enhanced considerably by devising suitable solution algorithms.

  Abstract                 = {The effects of mechanical and thermal surface loadings on deformation of elastic--plastic semi-infinite medium were analyzed simultaneously by using the finite element method. Rigid rough surface of a magnetic head and smooth surface of an elastic--plastic hard disk were chosen to perform a comprehensive thermo-elastic--plastic contact analysis at the head--disk interface (HDI). A two-dimensional finite element model of a rigid rough surface characterized by fractal geometry sliding over an elastic--plastic medium was then developed. The evolution of deformation in the semi-infinite medium due to thermomechanical surface loading is interpreted in terms of temperature, von Mises equivalent stress, and equivalent plastic strain. In addition to this, the effects of friction coefficient, sliding, and interference distance on deformation behavior were also analyzed. It is shown that frictional heating increases not only the contact area but also the contact pressure and stresses.},

  Abstract                 = {Thermal stresses as a result from frictional heating must be considered when designing disc brakes, clutches or other rotating machine components with sliding contact conditions. The rotational symmetry of the disc in these kind of applications makes it possible to model these systems using an Eulerian approach instead of a Lagrangian framework. In this paper such an approach is developed and implemented. The disc is formulated in an Eulerian frame where the convective terms are defined by the angular velocity. By utilizing the Eulerian framework, a node-to-node formulation of the contact interface is obtained, producing most accurate frictional heat power solutions. The energy balance of the interface is postulated by introducing an interfacial temperature. Both frictional power and contact conductances are included in this energy balance. The contact problem is solved by a non-smooth Newton method. By adopting the augmented Lagrangian approach, this is done by rewriting Signorini�s contact conditions to an equivalent semi-smooth equation. The heat transfer in the disc is discretized by a Petrov-Galerkin approach, i.e. the numerical difficulties due to the non-symmetric convective matrix appearing in a pure Galerkin discretization is treated by following the streamline-upwind approach. In such manner a stabilization is obtained by adding artificial conduction along the streamlines. For each time step the thermo-elastic contact problem is first solved for the temperature field from the previous time step. Then, the heat transfer problem is solved for the corresponding frictional power. In such manner a temperature history is obtained sequentially via the trapezoidal rule. In particular the parameter is set such that both the Crank-Nicolson and the Galerkin methods are utilized. The method seems very promising. This is demonstrated by solving a two-dimensional benchmark as well as a real disc brake system in three dimensions.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper presents an approach for assessing the accuracy of different frictional rolling contact theories. The main characteristic of the approach is that it takes a statistically oriented view. This yields a better insight into the behaviour of the methods in diverse circumstances (varying contact patch ellipticities, mixed longitudinal, lateral and spin creepages) than is obtained when only a small number of (basic) circumstances are used in the comparison. The range of contact parameters that occur for realistic vehicles and tracks are assessed using simulations with the Vampire vehicle system dynamics (VSD) package. This shows that larger values for the spin creepage occur rather frequently. Based on this, our approach is applied to typical cases for which railway VSD packages are used. The results show that particularly the USETAB approach but also FASTSIM give considerably better results than the linear theory, Vermeulen�Johnson, Shen�Hedrick�Elkins and Polach methods, when compared with the �complete theory� of the CONTACT program. },

Therefore, the discussion of dynamic thermoelasticity in rotating disks with stationary heat sources is of basic interest to understand the interaction of temperature and displacement or stress fields in such structural elements. It will be analyzed here in detail for the case of an elastic disk for which there is a full (but weak) coupling of strain and temperature within the two applications mentioned. As a relatively general case, the combined excitation by a mechanical load and a simultaneously acting heat source will be examined.},

The interdependent mechanical and thermal analyses are coupled by an iteration scheme using the transfer matrix method combined with the finite element technique. The significance of interaction among heat generation, temperature rise and contact conditions are interpreted in light of numerical results. It is shown that the constraint of the thermal expansion in the indentation direction between the contacting bodies plays a significant role in the increase of contact pressure and heat generation, which in turn affect the temperature rise and thermal expansion.},

  Abstract                 = {Two models for wheel-rail rolling contact that are based on the half-space assumption are compared in this paper: Hertz and the non-Hertzian method implemented in the computer program CONTACT. These two models are further restricted by the assumption of linear-elastic material behaviour. Moreover, one elastic and one elastic�plastic finite element model of the contact are investigated with the commercial code ABAQUS. The finite element method is not limited by the half-space assumption or applicable to a linear-elastic material model only. The objective is to assess the four methods based on calculated contact pressure, contact patch size and penetration depth. Contact loads and contact locations, used as input data in the analysis, are taken from a vehicle dynamics simulation in the software GENSYS. The comparison is performed at a given cross-section in the crossing panel of a selected turnout design. To fulfil the requirements of the half-space assumption, the dimensions of the contact area must be small compared to the radii of curvature of the bodies in contact. On the selected cross-section, however, the half-space assumption does not hold since the smallest radius of rail curvature at the contact point is 13mm, which is comparable to the largest semi-axis of the contact area. Nevertheless, it is found that the contact pressure distributions calculated using Hertz and \{CONTACT\} correlate well with those results obtained from the finite element method as long as no plastification of the material occurs.},

  Abstract                 = {The solution of contact problems involves great numerical efforts to satisfy non-penetration conditions. The search for numerical efficiency hence has limited the modelling of the real physical interface behaviour. Up to now mainly simple laws, usually formulated using constant coefficients, have been available to study contact problems in uncoupled from.Here a thermomechanically coupled contact element is presented which accounts for the real microscopic shape of the surfaces, the microscopic mechanism of force transmission and heat exchange. The contact element geometrical behaviour has been put together with experimental and theoretical well founded micro-mechanical and micro-thermal laws adapted to Finite Element Method (FEM) necessities. Based on these laws the macroscopic related stiffnesses are calculated and continuously updated taking into account changes in significant parameters. The linearization of the set of equations has been obtained using a consistent technique which implies computational efficiency.},

The element is capable of obtaining the contact fields of rolling/moving type structure such as tires, train wheels, roller bearings, etc. wherein steadily moving mechanical surface fields are involved. The contact algorithm is general in the sense that it can be applied to both linear and nonlinear problems wherin the full complement of inertial fields may be of importance. It can also handle the slip and non-slip conditions which may exist in the contact zone. Based on the algorithm developed, the results of several numerical experiments will be presented.},
