	can result in a stabilized scheme of the SUPG-type. Residual-Free
	Bubbles (RFB), in particular, can assure a quasi-optimal stabilized
	scheme, but they are difficult to compute in one dimension and nearly
	impossible to compute in two and three dimensions, unless in special
	limit cases. Strongly convection-dominated problems (without reaction
	terms) are one of these cases, where it is possible to find reasonably
	simple computable bubbles that provide a stabilizing effect as good
	as that of true RFB. Here, although in a one-dimensional framework,
	we analyze the case in which a non-negligible reaction term is present,
	and provide a simple recipe for spotting a suitable bubble space
	(adding two bubbles to each element) that provides a very good stabilizing
	effect. The method adapts very well to all regimes with continuous
	transitions from one regime to another. It is clear that the one-dimensional
	case, in itself, has no real interest. We believe, however, that
	the discussion can cast some light on the interaction between convection
	and reaction that could be useful in future works dealing with multidimensional,
	more realistic problems.},

	The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation

	to currently very active research area of the finite element modeling
	of flexible multibody system dynamics. To that end, we first briefly
	introduce three different model problems in non-linear dynamics of
	flexible 3D solid, a rigid body and 3D geometrically exact beam,
	which covers the vast majority of representative models for the particular
	components of a multibody system. The finite element semi-discretization
	for these models is presented along with the time-discretization
	performed by the mid-point scheme. In extending the proposed methodology
	to modeling of flexible multibody systems, we also present how to
	build a systematic representation of any kind of joint connecting
	two multibody components, a typical case of holonomic contraint,
	as a linear superposition of elementary constraints. We also indicate
	by a chosen model of rolling contact, an example of non-holonomic
	constraint, that the latter can also be included within the proposed
	framework. An important aspect regarding the reduction of computational
	cost while retaining the consistency of the model is also addressed
	in terms of systematic use of the rigid component hypothesis, mass
	lumping and the appropriate application of the explicit--implicit
	time-integration scheme to the problem on hand. Several numerical
	simulations dealing with non-linear dynamics of flexible multibody

  abstract = {Rolling contact stress and failure analyses were conducted for the
	Hadfield steel (manganese steel) and the Bainitic alloy (J7). The
	first alloy is used in diamond crossings and frogs in the railroad
	industry while the second alloy is a candidate for such applications.
	A series of fatigue experiments were conducted on these alloys to
	establish the damage parameters. The proposed fatigue damage parameter
	incorporated the role of both shear and normal stress ranges on the
	`critical' plane upon surveying all planes at a material point. Maximum
	local plastic strains, accumulated strains, and three-dimensional
	residual stresses were computed under pure rolling conditions for
	po/k (Hertzian pressure normalized by yield stress in shear) values
	in the range 4.0 to 8.0 using a semi-analytical approach. A multiaxial
	stress–strain plasticity model developed by the authors was used
	in the calculations of the contact stress and strain fields. The
	advantage of this model over the previous models is that it predicts
	the correct trends in the material ratchetting rate and non-proportional
	loading response. For life prediction, a new combined ratchetting--multiaxial
	fatigue damage model was presented. The damage at different depths
	below the surface was interrogated with this model to determine the
	location where failure will originate. The results show that the
	Bainitic alloy exhibits longer lives under the same Hertzian pressure
	and for both materials the life is finite when the normalized pressure,
	po/k ratio, exceeded 4.0.},

  abstract = {The method for the development of the equations of motion for systems
	of constrained particles and rigid bodies, developed by T. R. Kane
	and called Kane's Equations, is discussed from a geometric viewpoint.
	It is shown that what Kane calls partial velocities and partial angular
	velocities may be interpreted as components of tangent vectors to
	the system's configuration manifold. The geometric picture, when
	attached to Kane's formalism shows that Kane's Equations are projections
	of the Newton-Euler equations of motion onto a spanning set of the
	configuration manifold's tangent space. One advantage of Kane's method,
	is that both non-holonomic and non-conservative systems are easily
	included in the same formalism. This easily follows from the geometry.
	It is also shown that by transformation to an orthogonal spanning
	set, the equations can be diagonalized in terms of what Kane calls
	the generalized speeds. A further advantage of the geometric picture
	lies in the treatment of constraint forces which can be expanded
	in terms of a spanning set for the orthogonal complement of the configuration
	tangent space. In all these developments, explicit use is made of
	a concrete realization of the multidimensional vectors which are
	called K-vectors for a K-component system. It is argued that the
	current presentation also provides a clear tutorial route to Kane's
	method for those schooled in classical analytical mechanics.},

  abstract = {We examine a bubble-stabilized finite element method for enforcing
	Dirichlet constraints on embedded interfaces. By ‘embedded’ we refer
	to problems of general interest wherein the geometry of the interface
	is assumed independent of some underlying bulk mesh. As such, the
	robust imposition of Dirichlet constraints using a Lagrange multiplier
	field is not trivial. To focus issues, we consider a simple one-sided
	problem that is representative of a wide class of evolving-interface
	problems. The bulk field is decomposed into coarse and fine scales,
	giving rise to coarse-scale and fine-scale one-sided sub-problems.
	The fine-scale solution is approximated with bubble functions, permitting
	static condensation and giving rise to a stabilized form bearing
	strong analogy with a classical method. Importantly, the method is
	simple to implement, readily extends to multiple dimensions, obviates
	the need to specify any free stabilization parameters, and can lead
	to a symmetric, positive-definite system of equations. The performance
	of the method is then examined through several numerical examples.
	The accuracy of the Lagrange multiplier is compared to results obtained
	using a local version of the domain integral method. The variational
	multiscale approach proposed herein is shown to both stabilize the
	Lagrange multiplier and improve the accuracy of the post-processed

  pages = {4299--4322},
  abstract = {Numerical methods for the analysis of rolling contact problems are
	of high importance for the optimization of the components, car tires
	for example. Today, finite element methods for the computation of
	stationary rolling contact have been developed for industrial use.
	However, from a review of the scientific literature it has been concluded
	that the theoretical foundations of the relative kinematic description,
	i.e. an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation, seems to
	be not well understood in detail. This presentation is aimed to close
	this gap. Starting from the basic kinematic description of the ALE-formulation
	of rolling the weak form of the equations of motion are developed.
	By this careful analysis an additional flux contribution is derived
	which has not been recognized in the scientific literature so far.
	The contact problem is described for the treatment of two deformable
	bodies in rolling contact within the framework of well established
	methods for the numerical treatment of contact in the Lagrangian
	picture in general. Essential differences between the Lagrangian
	description and the ALE-description of rolling are shown up and discussed
	in detail. For a comprehensive presentation the finite element discretization
	is restricted to the case of a deformable wheel rolling on a rigid
	plane surface. However, the sketched algorithmic approach is valid
	in general. The efficiency of the numerical algorithms developed
	so far are discussed by the analysis of a simple three-dimensional
	example. Critical remarks and an outlook to further research in this
	field concludes this presentation.},

  abstract = {Thermal stresses as a result from frictional heating must be considered
	when designing disc brakes, clutches or other rotating machine components
	with sliding contact conditions. The rotational symmetry of the disc
	in these kind of applications makes it possible to model these systems
	using an Eulerian approach instead of a Lagrangian framework. In
	this paper such an approach is developed and implemented. The disc
	is formulated in an Eulerian frame where the convective terms are
	defined by the angular velocity. By utilizing the Eulerian framework,
	a node-to-node formulation of the contact interface is obtained,
	producing most accurate frictional heat power solutions. The energy
	balance of the interface is postulated by introducing an interfacial
	temperature. Both frictional power and contact conductances are included
	in this energy balance. The contact problem is solved by a non-smooth
	Newton method. By adopting the augmented Lagrangian approach, this
	is done by rewriting Signorini’s contact conditions to an equivalent
	semi-smooth equation. The heat transfer in the disc is discretized
	by a Petrov-Galerkin approach, i.e. the numerical difficulties due
	to the non-symmetric convective matrix appearing in a pure Galerkin
	discretization is treated by following the streamline-upwind approach.
	In such manner a stabilization is obtained by adding artificial conduction
	along the streamlines. For each time step the thermo-elastic contact
	problem is first solved for the temperature field from the previous
	time step. Then, the heat transfer problem is solved for the corresponding
	frictional power. In such manner a temperature history is obtained
	sequentially via the trapezoidal rule. In particular the parameter
	is set such that both the Crank-Nicolson and the Galerkin methods
	are utilized. The method seems very promising. This is demonstrated
	by solving a two-dimensional benchmark as well as a real disc brake
	system in three dimensions.},
